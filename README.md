## Getting Started


Once settled in your groups decide who will be the **Git Czar**.

### Git Czar


1. Duplicate the original repo
 
  1.1. Clone down the original repo, without **forking it**. 
  
  1.2. Create a new repository on your GitHub account.
  
  1.3. Set(or change) the remote of the cloned repo to your new repo.
  
  `git remote set-url https://github.com/your-username/name-of-the-new-repo`
  
  1.4. Add, commit and push to master
  

2. Add a develop branch on your remote repository 
![](./assets/add_branch.png)

3. Now that you have a remote `dev` branch let's go ahead and set it as the **default** branch of our repository. 

4. Your default branch is named `master`. If you have admin rights over a repository on GitHub, you can change the default branch on the repository. [Setting the default branch](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/setting-the-default-branch)

5. In Settings, in the left menu, click Branches.

Update the `dev` to be the default branch.

6. Create branch protection rules  
- Click on settings and then branches
- Under **Branch name pattern** enter the name of your branch - dev
- Check Require pull request reviews before merging
- Check Require view from Code Owners   
- Save Changes

7. In **Settings**, under **Manage Access**, add your team members.

8. Create a group chat in Slack and and share the link of **your fork** with your team.

9. Your team members should have received an invitation to collaborate via email.


### All members

1. **Clone** the repo to your local machine and `cd` into it.

2. Create a branch as yourname-dev 
```bash 
git checkout -b <your-name-dev>
``` 

### Member A 

1. Proceed to client/App.js and delete all the boilerplate provided. Replace it with: 

```
import React, { Component } from 'react'

export default class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Practice</h1>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

2. Add, commit and push to yourname-dev. 
3. Create a pull request and wait for the Git Czar to approve it and merge it.
4. Since you are the **first** person to push changes to the source code, there will be no merge conflict.


### All members


1. Create a branch as yourname-dev `git checkout -b yourname-dev`. 
    > (i.e., git checkout -b svetla-dev).

2. `cd` into `client` and make changes to different files - maybe include a `<p>/<a>/<img>` tag inside in the render() in App.js, create new component and/or add few lines of CSS to App.css

3. `cd ..` or just `..` of `client` directory and add,commit and push the changes to **your** branch. 

4. `git add .` and `git commit -m <your-message-here>`

5. `git pull origin dev` to get the latest changes from `dev` branch and possibly resolve a merge conflict inside your code editor


6. Create a pull request on GitHub. Inform the Git Tzar that you did a pull request and there are no merge conflicts.



### When all pull requests have been merged, Git Tzar does:

1. Merge the changes from `dev` to `master`
	
* `git checkout master`
* `git pull origin dev`
* `git push origin master` - to update the remote branch `master`

**OR**
                
* `git checkout dev` 
* `git pull origin dev` - update the local branch `dev`   
*  `git checkout master`
* `git merge dev`
* `git push origin master` - to update the remote branch `master`

2.  Delete the remote branches `git push origin --delete remote-branch`


### All members

1. Checkout to `dev` or to a new branch of yours and delete your old local branch

 `git branch -d yourname-branch` 

[-d or -D ?](https://koukia.ca/delete-a-local-and-a-remote-git-branch-61df0b10d323)



If you want to see your commit history: 

`git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all` 

---

### Special situations/useful commands to remember

## All members can practice those on their local branches

1. Undoing `git add .`

  * checkout to a new branch
  * make a change on any file
  * Stage your changes with `git add .`
  * `git status` - confirm the changes have been staged
  * `git reset`
  * `git status` - confirm the changes have been unstaged


If you staged files for commit but you weren't ready to commit them, simply `git reset` .This will undo `git add .` Super useful when you forgot to include your `.gitignore` file.

---

2. If you added and committed your changes but you realize you made a mistake/have a bug/don't want it, don't panic and don't push. 


```
➜  git-group-fullstack git:(dev) ✗ git commit -m "new.js"
[dev b7c053d] new.js
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 new.js
```

**Instead:**  
`git revert <unwanted commit hash>` 

In this case, the commit hash is `b7c053d`. So, `git revert b7c053d` will undo/revert that commit by creating a new **commit**. This will bring the VIM interface which looks like that: 

```
Revert "new.js"
  
This reverts commit 58ceee04a7fe86064037efe4d709a619387d89bf.

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# On branch dev
# Changes to be committed:
#       modified:   new.js
"~/GeneralAssembly/work/git-group-fullstack/.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG" 11L, 283C
```
 * press `i`, go to a line without a `#` and type your commit message 
 * press Esc and type `:qa!`

Type `git status` to verify what you just did. As you can see on the code below, we successfuly reverted the commit and `new.js` file is not being staged or committed.

```
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        new.js

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

You can also see all commits of all branches and get the commit hash from there by typing: 

`git log --oneline` or simply `git log`

You can read more about `git revert` here - [how-to-revert-commit](http://christoph.ruegg.name/blog/git-howto-revert-a-commit-already-pushed-to-a-remote-reposit.html)
Be careful with this command. 

**In order to reproduce this scenario make a change to a file, add and commit and then try and revert the commit.**

---

3. You are on your branch, you did some changes locally. Let's say you want to switch branches, but you don’t want to commit what you’ve been working on yet, instead you’ll stash the changes. You may find this command useful if you forgot to pull the latest changes from `dev`. 

To push a new stash onto your stack, run: 
`git add .`
`git stash`

Now you have a clean working directory and you can `git pull origin dev`.

Once you see the changes applied locally from the `dev` branch go ahead and apply your stash by running `git stash apply`.

**In order to reproduce this scenario:(switching between branches and applying stash to a new branch)**

1. Checkout to a new local branch - `git checkout -b yourname-dev-test`
1. Make a change to a file
2. `git add .` 
3. `git stash`
4. Checkout to a different local branch - `git checkout -b new-yourname-dev-test`
5. Apply the stash - `git stash apply`

Be careful with this one too! You can have more than one stash, `git stash list` to see all your stashes and select which stash you want. In this case you had only one, so it automatically applied it.
